title: New documentation site!
author: Thomas Lindner

I'm excited to launch a new documentation site. Why the change?

  1. Now anyone can contribute changes.
  2. Docs can be bundled with the PR they are associated with.
  3. Easier to navigate

The site is pretty rough and basic right now. Logo, improved design, etc. will hopefully be added soon. Let me know if you have any suggestions on making the docs better!
